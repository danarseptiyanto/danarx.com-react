![Tailwind CSS Utility Classes](https://tailwindcss.com/_next/static/media/social-card-large.6c9c7d61.jpg)

Tailwind CSS has changed the way developers think about styling. Many frameworks add layers of abstraction, but Tailwind takes the opposite approach — it brings you *closer* to CSS rather than further away.

### Why Tailwind Feels Familiar

If you’ve written regular CSS before, picking up Tailwind feels natural.
Classes like `text-center`, `bg-blue-500`, and `mt-4` map directly to properties you already know:

```html
<div class="text-center bg-blue-500 mt-4 p-6 rounded-lg">
  <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-semibold">Hello Tailwind!</h2>
</div>
