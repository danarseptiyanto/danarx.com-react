Styling CSS is fun and all but the job quickly becomes very tedious and annoying to maintain once the project grows bigger and bigger. At least that's what I experience building some websites using vanilla css. The problem with the traditional approach of CSS is sometimes the HTML and the CSS are too separated that it feels like a jenga game whenever we move, edit, or delete some line of CSS because how it might break your style somewhere else. In short, it's a mess.

The reason above is what makes me interested in dipping my toes into the world of Tailwind CSS, my intention at first is just to try thing out but once I finished my first mini project with it, I can't see myself using vanilla CSS again, especially on a component based project like React JS or laravel blade templating. The most surprising thing that I learned when trying out Tailwind is how well thought out everything is, everything is so intuitive that it basically like writing a regular CSS except it's not separated from your HTML and you wrote a lot less code.

The best advice I've got about learning Tailwind is not to be bother with tutorial or course about tailwind and just jump straight into project after skimming the official documentation. The tailwind team really done an amazing job translating CSS into their own inline style that very minimalist but very clearly thought out too. It makes learning tailwind the most fun I've experienced on my journey of learning web development.

If you're working with CSS and up to learning new things, I implore you to try Tailwind CSS.
